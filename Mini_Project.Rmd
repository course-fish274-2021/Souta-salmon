## Concepts

Does managing fisheries for wildlife limit salmon consumption by bears in Alaskan?

In this document I will:

1. Load data from the [Managing salmon for wildlife do fisheries limit salmon consumption by bears in small Alaskan streams dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Managing_salmon_for_wildlife_do_fisheries_limit_salmon_consumption_by_bears_in_small_Alaskan_streams_/10315925)
2. Process it into population add image 
3. And make initial visualizations


## import Data

```{r cache=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("Managing_salmon_for_wildlife_Data.csv")
head()
```

```{r, cache=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

`
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
